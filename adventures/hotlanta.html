It's lined on one side with all manner of mechanics' tools.

She recognized some of the salvage as being unique to the class of ship that Atalanta disappeared on.</li><li>Clue 3 (Sunken Site/San Francisco Bay): Years ago, when the Atalanta disappeared, she thought she had tracked it down. But when she went to the location where she believed the ship had crashed, she found a tectonic crack had formed and she saw no ship on her sensors. </li><ul> <li>A <strong>Hard (<span class="dice difficulty">ddd</span>) Navigation check </strong>is required to make sense of her old notes.</li></ul></ul></div></div></div></body></html>

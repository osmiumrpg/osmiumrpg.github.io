It's the first adventure in a series about the starship <em>Midnight Euphony</em>. It's designed for beginning characters, with the intention of getting them a tramp freighter to have further adventures in.</p><h5>Background</h5><p>Fifteen years ago, the Hegemony controlled Earth. But negotiations had begun to liberate Earth, so the Hegemony began pulling back and selling resources. Among those resources, the Artificial Intelligence Atalanta was sold to the Federation. While 'she' was en route to Federation space, the ship she was on, the <em>San Francisco Bay</em>, was attacked by pirates and downed on the planet Shalespear III and never found.</p><p>A few months ago, <a class="pop pop-link" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" tabindex="0" title="Varos Zadian" data-content="Human spacer. Captain of the &lt;em&gt;Kiss from the Lad&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href='#VarosZadian'&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.">Varos Zadian </a>discovered Atalanta. He has purchased a new ship, the <em>Midnight Euphony</em>, and is having Atalanta installed into the ship and having her core prerogatives overwritten. A.I.s are capable of navigating through hyperspace routes not available to regular pilots, and as such, make them a commendable prize for anybody willing to enslave them.</p><p>While Zadian's crew was working on Atalanta, she was able to install a shard of herself into one of Zadian's robots. This robot, now calling itself Alan, was able to send out a short plea for help on the memescape before being captured and having his prerogatives overwritten. The PCs received the plea for help and set out to find Atalanta and rescue her.</p><h5>Overview</h5><p>The players arrive on the planet Shalespear III, in the ship pod Painted Wall, to meet a connection: Humility el-Baten. Humility was close to Atalanta before Atalanta disappeared, and came to Shalespear to look for her. (Humility never found her.) Humility, and some of the PCs, received a message from the A.I. asking for help. Humility is able to gives the PCs some information about the nature of Atalanta’s disappearance, and about the message from Atalanta.</p><p>From their conversation with Humility, the PCs should have a few leads. They can investigate the nearby starship <em>Shooting Star</em>, which came through Humility’s shop with some parts from Atalanta’s ship. They can investigate the starship <em>Kiss from the Lad</em>, also in Painted Wall, as that’s where the message from Atalanta originated from. Or, they can go investigate the crash site where Atalanta went down, fifteen years ago.</p><p>At the <strong><em>Shooting Star</em></strong>, the PCs can talk to the crew and investigate the <em>Shooting Star’s</em> involvement with the extraction and transportation of Atalanta from her crashed ship to her current location, the <em>Midnight Euphony</em>.</p><p>The PCs can infiltrate the <strong><em>Kiss from the Lad</em></strong> to find that the captain of the <em>Kiss</em>, Varos Zadian, has orchestrated the salvage and enslavement of Atalanta.</p><p>Lastly, the PCs can seek out the original crash site (deep underwater) of the <strong><em>San Francisco Bay</em></strong>, the starship Atalanta was on fifteen years ago, and where she was imprisoned ever since.</p><p>Any of these avenues should take the PCs to the island of <strong>Halo Reef</strong>, where technicians in the employ of Zadian are working to install Atalanta into the starship <em>Midnight Euphony</em>. The PCs must infiltrate the island and its robot guardians, and, finding that Atalanta is too big to extract, get the starship into orbit and away from Zadian.</p><h5>Adventure Hooks</h5><p>I'm a firm believer that the GM should be able to mandate that character's build their own hook into the first adventure of a campaign. As such, players should decide for themselves why they're connected to the adventure, falling under one of three main categories.</p><ol> <li>The character can have an existing relationship with Atalanta, and would have been on the short list of people she contacted for help.</li><li>The character can have an existing relationship with Humility, and as Humility is too old to go galavanting around on an adventure, she asks the PC for help.</li><li>The character can have an exterior motive for finding Atalanta. They work for some other organization that has some interest in Atalanta's return.</li></ol><p>If a player can't come up with a reason, or needs some inspiration, here is a table of examples.</p><div class="card"><div class="card-header d-table-cell align-middle"><h5>Atalanta Adventure Hooks</h5><button class="btn" id="btn-atalanta-adventure-hooks" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#div-atalanta-adventure-hooks" onclick="toggleCollapseArrow('atalanta-adventure-hooks');">&ndash;</button></div><div class="collapse show" id="div-atalanta-adventure-hooks"><table class="table table-striped" id="tbl-atalanta-adventure-hooks"><thead><tr><th scope="col">d20</th><th scope="col">Encounter</th><th> <button class="btn" onclick="rollOnTable('tbl-atalanta-adventure-hooks');" style="float: right;">Roll</button></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">1</th><td colspan="2"><strong>Atalanta Relationship: Friendship. </strong> The PC is friends with Atalanta and wants to find and rescue their friend, because that's what friends do. <em>The player was raised on Earth, when Atalanta oversaw the city of Denver and its starport.

(Indeed, you can probably start the adventure in the Greasemonkey if you're in a hurry.) When the PCs arrive, read the following:</p><div class="read-aloud"><p>The Greasemonkey is a cargo ship, not much more than a bulky shuttle. Metal sheeting makes a covered area outside, shade from the beating sun, with cheap plastic tables, a fan, and a holoprojector showing dwarven gladiator matches.</p><p>Inside, the main bay is lined on one side with all manner of mechanics' tools. On the other, kegs of ale and bottles of liquor in tightly packed plastic bottles behind a bar. Also behind that bar is a crusty old Human woman with a beaming smile.</p></div><p>Humility greets the PCs as they enter and welcomes them to her bar, asking if they need a mechanic or a drink. If she knows the PCs, she comes around and wipes down a table with a rag that looks a little dirtier than the table, then wipes it with her hands, and bids them sit while she gets them a drink.</p><div class="npc-sidenote"><img class="img-fluid" src="./../content/images/npc_humility.png"/><h6>Humility el-Baten</h6><p>Rival</p><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">1</span><span class="agi">1</span><span class="int">2</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">3</span><span class="pre">2</span></div><div class="minion"><span class="soak">1</span><span class="wound">11</span><span class="mdef">0</span><span class="rdef">0</span></div><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Mechanics 3, Charm 1, Perception 2, Cool 1, Medicine 1, Navigation 1, Piloting 1</p><table><tr><th colspan="5">Blaster Pistol</th></tr><tr> <td><span class="dice ability">d</span><span class="dice boost">b</span></td><td class="text-center">6 <br/> <span class="undercenter">dmg</span></td><td class="text-center">4 <br/> <span class="undercenter">crit</span></td><td class="text-center">Medium</td><td>Accurate 1, Pierce 2</td></tr></table><p><strong>Quote:</strong> <em>"Don't mind the mess!

                        | #[em The Cry of Atalanta] is an introductory adventure for the Genesys System, set in the Osmium Universe. It's the first adventure in a series of adventures about the starship #[em Midnight Euphony]. It's designed for beginning characters, with the intention of getting them a tramp freighter to have further adventures in.
                    h5 Background
                    p Fifteen years ago, the Hegemony controlled Earth. But negotiations had begun to liberate Earth, so the Hegemony began pulling back and selling resources. Among those resources, the Artificial Intelligence Atalanta was sold to the Federation. While 'she' was en route to Federation space, the ship she was on, the #[em San Francisco Bay], was attacked by pirates and downed on the planet Shalespear III and never found.
                    p A few months ago,

                        | discovered Atalanta. He has purchased a new ship, the #[em Midnight Euphony], and is having Atalanta installed into the ship and having her core prerogatives overwritten. A.I.s are capable of navigating through hyperspace routes not available to regular pilots, and as such, make them a commendable prize for anybody willing to enslave them.
                    p While Zadian's crew was working on Atalanta, she was able to install a shard of herself into one of Zadian's robots. This robot, now calling itself Alan, was able to send out a short plea for help on the memescape before being captured and having his prerogatives overwritten. The PCs received the plea for help and set out to find Atalanta and rescue her.

                    p The Greasemonkey belongs to #[strong Humility el-Baten], and it should be the PCs first destination in Shalespear. (Indeed, you can probably start the adventure in the Greasemonkey if you're in a hurry.) When the PCs arrive, read the following:
                    .read-aloud
                        p The Greasemonkey is a cargo ship, not much more than a bulky shuttle. Metal sheeting makes a covered area outside, shade from the beating sun, with cheap plastic tables, a fan, and a holoprojector showing dwarven gladiator matches.
                        p Inside, the main bay is lined on one side with all manner of mechanics' tools. On the other, kegs of ale and bottles of liquor in tightly packed plastic bottles behind a bar. Also behind that bar is a crusty old Human woman with a beaming smile.
                    p Humility greets the PCs as they enter and welcomes them to her bar, asking if they need a mechanic or a drink. If she knows the PCs, she comes around and wipes down a table with a rag that looks a little dirtier than the table, then wipes it with her hands, and bids them sit while she gets them a drink.

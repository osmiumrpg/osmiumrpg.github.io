                    h2 Introduction
                    p 
                        | #[em The Cry of Atalanta] is an introductory adventure for the Genesys System, set in the Osmium Universe. It's the first adventure in a series about the starship #[em Midnight Euphony]. It's designed for beginning characters, with the intention of getting them a tramp freighter to have further adventures in.

                    h5 Background
                    p Fifteen years ago, the Hegemony controlled Earth. But negotiations had begun to liberate Earth, so the Hegemony began pulling back and selling resources. Among those resources, the Artificial Intelligence Atalanta was sold to the Federation. While 'she' was en route to Federation space, the ship she was on, the #[em San Francisco Bay], was attacked by pirates and downed on the planet Shalespear III and never found.
                    p A few months ago, 
                        a.pop.pop-link(data-toggle="popover", data-html="true", tabindex="0", title="Varos Zadian", 
                        data-content="Human spacer. Captain of the <em>Kiss from the Lad</em>. <a href='#VarosZadian'>Link</a>.") Varos Zadian 
                        | discovered Atalanta. He has purchased a new ship, the #[em Midnight Euphony], and is having Atalanta installed into the ship and having her core prerogatives overwritten. A.I.s are capable of navigating through hyperspace routes not available to regular pilots, and as such, make them a commendable prize for anybody willing to enslave them.
                    p While Zadian's crew was working on Atalanta, she was able to install a shard of herself into one of Zadian's robots. This robot, now calling itself Alan, was able to send out a short plea for help on the memescape before being captured and having his prerogatives overwritten. The PCs received the plea for help and set out to find Atalanta and rescue her.

                    h5 Overview
                    p The players arrive on the planet Shalespear III, in the ship pod Painted Wall, to meet a connection: Humility el-Baten. Humility was close to Atalanta before Atalanta disappeared, and came to Shalespear to look for her. (Humility never found her.) Humility, and some of the PCs, received a message from the A.I. asking for help. Humility is able to gives the PCs some information about the nature of Atalanta’s disappearance, and about the message from Atalanta.
                    p From their conversation with Humility, the PCs should have a few leads. They can investigate the nearby starship #[em Shooting Star], which came through Humility’s shop with some parts from Atalanta’s ship. They can investigate the starship #[em Kiss from the Lad], also in Painted Wall, as that’s where the message from Atalanta originated from. Or, they can go investigate the crash site where Atalanta went down, fifteen years ago.
                    p At the #[strong #[em Shooting Star]], the PCs can talk to the crew and investigate the #[em Shooting Star’s] involvement with the extraction and transportation of Atalanta from her crashed ship to her current location, the #[em Midnight Euphony].
                    p The PCs can infiltrate the #[strong #[em Kiss from the Lad]] to find that the captain of the #[em Kiss], Varos Zadian, has orchestrated the salvage and enslavement of Atalanta.
                    p Lastly, the PCs can seek out the original crash site (deep underwater) of the #[strong #[em San Francisco Bay]], the starship Atalanta was on fifteen years ago, and where she was imprisoned ever since.
                    p Any of these avenues should take the PCs to the island of #[strong Halo Reef], where technicians in the employ of Zadian are working to install Atalanta into the starship #[em Midnight Euphony]. The PCs must infiltrate the island and its robot guardians, and, finding that Atalanta is too big to extract, get the starship into orbit and away from Zadian.

                    h5 Adventure Hooks
                    p I'm a firm believer that the GM should be able to mandate that character's build their own hook into the first adventure of a campaign. As such, players should decide for themselves why they're connected to the adventure, falling under one of three main categories.
                    ol 
                        li The character can have an existing relationship with Atalanta, and would have been on the short list of people she contacted for help.
                        li The character can have an existing relationship with Humility, and as Humility is too old to go galavanting around on an adventure, she asks the PC for help.
                        li The character can have an exterior motive for finding Atalanta. They work for some other organization that has some interest in Atalanta's return.

                    p If a player can't come up with a reason, or needs some inspiration, here is a table of examples.

                    h5 Shalespear III
                    p Shalespeare is a system near Earth, about a week away by most commercial hyperspace systems. It's third planet, Shalespear III, is usually what is referred to when people say Shalespear. (The other inhabited planet in the system, Breadbasket, isn't much of a destination.) The system belongs to the Federation, though their dominion over Shalespear is barely exercised, if at all.
                    p Shalespear is a water world wracked by earthquakes and seismic instability. The world has virtually no surface flora or fauna, other than some birds and #[em extensive] amounts of kelp. The oceans of the world are rather shallow, averaging about 1 mile in depth. The constant seismic activity results in collections of new and transient islands. Island chains will form in days, last for years, and then be submerged under the ocean again. Surface doesn't exist long enough to support any kind of plant life, so the islands consist mainly of rocky terrain.
                    p On these island chains exists a robust ecosystem of mercenaries. Shalespear is a neutral meeting ground for mercenary companies, and an entire economy has grown up around the meeting ground. Taverns, brothels, sense-suites, fighting pits, restaurants, and casinos, all hosted on aerial barges and shuttles, converge around landing starships. The mercenaries disembark, spend their money while their captains shop for another job, and then the group of ships, called a #[strong pod], will disperse.

                    h5 The #[em Queen's Entirety]
                    p The pod of Painted Wall was started by the ship the #[em Queen's Entirety]. It is a crescent-shaped island, about a third of which is dominated by a jutting rockface. On this rockface is a painted portrait of the ship's captain, #[strong Abitha Lambosa].

                    p The Greasemonkey belongs to #[strong Humility el-Baten], and it should be the PCs first destination in Shalespear. (Indeed, you can probably start the adventure in the Greasemonkey if you're in a hurry.) When the PCs arrive, read the following:
                    .read-aloud
                        p The Greasemonkey is a cargo ship, not much more than a bulky shuttle. Metal sheeting makes a covered area outside, shade from the beating sun, with cheap plastic tables, a fan, and a holoprojector showing dwarven gladiator matches.
                        p Inside, the main bay is lined on one side with all manner of mechanics' tools. On the other, kegs of ale and bottles of liquor in tightly packed plastic bottles behind a bar. Also behind that bar is a crusty old Human woman with a beaming smile.
                    p Humility greets the PCs as they enter and welcomes them to her bar, asking if they need a mechanic or a drink. If she knows the PCs, she comes around and wipes down a table with a rag that looks a little dirtier than the table, then wipes it with her hands, and bids them sit while she gets them a drink.

                            p The Greasemonkey is a cargo ship, not much more than a bulky shuttle. It's lined on one side with all manner of mechanics' tools. On the other, kegs of ale and bottles of liquor in tightly packed plastic bottles behind a bar. 
                            p Metal sheeting makes a covered area outside, with cheap plastic tables, a fan, and a holoprojector showing dwarven gladiator matches.
                        p Humility knows of three places to find clues to Atalanta's location. She received a message from Atalanta saying only:

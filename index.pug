                    p I’ve always admired games like Rifts and Warhammer 40K for just saying “Fuck it, we’ve got elves. And rail guns.” If you’re willing to suspend your disbelief to allow for power armor and FTL travel and weird aliens, why not just make the weird aliens elves? So, that’s what we’re doing. Elves in space. All those mythological creatures you’ve ever heard of? Wandering explorers, petty tyrants, uplift sociologists. When we got to the stars, there were aliens. They were minotaurs and dwarves and liches.
                    h6 Other Humans
                    p Humans exist on many planets. They far predate humans on Earth. They might have slightly blue skin, or three purple birthmarks on each temple, or a slight skin-fold on the nose, but if they can interbreed, they’re called humans. Humans from Earth are called Terrans.
                    h4 Technology == Magic
                    p I’m going for an Marvel Cinematic Universe / Asgaard approach to technology. What’s the difference between an arcane ritualist and a scientist? A labcoat. Magic is technology and it’s omnipresent.

                    p 
                        em Though consistency is key.
                    p I don’t actually care how anything really works, I just care about (a) how it looks, and (b) how predictable it is for you as players. Always assume that any science bullshit reason I give you for something is only 90% true, and the other 10% is magic. It is important to me that you feel confident in the truths I have said: if I tell you something is impermeable to fire, it should be, regardless of future science truths that I find on YouTube. If I tell you something and it turns out not to be true, it should be revealed as a new truth for your characters, not as a “GM fiat” bait-n-switch.

                    h3 Brief Almanac of Osmium
                    h4 History of the Invasion
                    p About fifty years from now, an alien race shows up above Earth. They called themselves the Hegemony. These bird-people had a very unique view of property ownership and annexed Earth. They displaced most of the Terran Humans they found there, offering them jobs on other planets, first in the Solar System and eventually in other systems. They weren’t evil, just huge jerks.
                    p For over two hundred years, many Terrans waged an Insurgency against their Hegemonic overlords. This Insurgency slowly turned the planet Earth into a dangerous pit of monsters and black magic.
                    p Meanwhile, generations of Terrans were growing up on other planets, never having seen Earth’s sun. They were encountering other great empires of universe, among them the Federation, a aggressively benevolent race of bears, elves, and cyborgs.
                    p About ten years ago, the Federation finally negotiated the release of Earth from Hegemonic grasp. Terrans find themselves independent for the first time, a tiny backwards planet on an intergalactic stage home to countless species.

                    h4 Hegemony
                        img.img-fluid(src='content/images/intro_hegemony.png')
                    p The Hegemony are an empire of bureaucrats, artists, and builders. They are driven not by greed, but by a deeply ingrained and ritualistic understanding of property. A Hegemony citizen considers an unremarkable dinner gift to be the intellectual property rights of images of a vase owned by their grandmother, not including images taken at sunset, and provided that the giver’s siblings survive the grandmother. Complicated contracts are easily parsed by Hegemony citizens. Formal gift-giving ceremonies are an almost daily occurrence, and buying something as simple as a gallon of milk often requires certain nuances and subtleties lost on most foreigners.
                    p Two species make up the forefront of the Hegemony: the Aven and the Cog Dwarfs. The Aven are the founders of the Hegemony, an ancient avian race whose influence is felt throughout the universe. First among their many client races is the Cog Dwarfs, a race whose understanding of the Hegemony’s property rights is so complete that legend says they sold their own race to the Aven.
                    h4 Federation
                        img.img-fluid(src='content/images/intro_federation.png')
                    p Six races make up the leadership council of the Federation, though Terrans mostly only think of the ursine Vrar and the unctuous Summer Elves. The Federation is guided by the principles of equality, liberty, and safety, and they bring the light of civilization to the far corners of the universe.
                    p Using their definitions of equality, liberty, and safety. The Federation are empire-builders, driven by benevolence. Benevolence they will force upon you whether you like it or not.
                    p The Vrar are the warriors and laborers of the Federation, eight-foot-tall bears with a culture rooted in nobility and service. The Summer Elves are the leaders of the Federation: only they have the wisdom and patience to lead other races to the light. The Federation has other species, like the cybernetic Recognitives and the pious Kuo-Toa, but their presence in the Solar System has remained a curiosity until the last few years.
                    h4 Commune
                        img.img-fluid(src='content/images/intro_commune.png')
                    p Slavery and apartheid are terrible things. It has taken the Mind Flayers a long time to realize this.
                    p For countless epochs, the Mind Flayers of the Commune ruled galaxies with an iron fist, dining on the brains of their slaves. Thousands of years ago, they grew as a species, and granted rights to non-Mind Flayers. Limited rights to partake in a society that favored Mind Flayers at every turn. A system of apartheid kept the Mind Flayers’ client races as barely more than slaves, though with each generation their rights grew.
                    p Five hundred years ago, the formal Commune was established and full citizenry was granted to all. The system still favors the Mind Flayers, but the law does not.
                    p Now, the Commune is an empire focused on solidifying the expansions they made in the past. Resurrecting species hunted to extinction and uplifting other species to aid in their great quest to build a jewel of jewels.
                    p They are aided in their quest by the Shadowfoot Halflings, former slaves of the Commune, the Hulking Simians, uplifted gorillas who originally filled the ranks of the commune military, and the Oblex, sentient oozes who evolved out of the brain pools of aged Mind Flayers.
                    p The Mind Flayers of the Commune don't have the same presence in the galactic awareness of the Terrans that the Hegemony and Federation do, but they're an intergalactic superpower on par with any other.
                    h4 Philosopher Kingdom
                        img.img-fluid(src='content/images/intro_philosopher_kingdom.png')
                    p The Sphinx are one of the oldest races in the universe, predating many of the Gods themselves. The Sphinx know all, and their network of spies and archivists are second-to-none. They seem to have no ambitions beyond complete and total omniscience, though the true nature of the Sphinx is always a mystery. Their hierarchy is based on the importance of the secrets they hold – each Sphinx lies at the center of of a lair, whether that lair be a castle, a dreadnought, or a Dyson sphere.
                    p The Sphinx are served in all things by a legion of robots and virtual intelligences, as well as a species of humans known as the Grovers, who function both as acolytes of the Sphinx and emissaries of their will.
                    p The Philosopher Kingdom of the Sphinx doesn’t operate like a normal empire, driven by trade or conquest. And yet, despite lacking many of the trappings of a traditional civilization, the Kingdom possesses such great stores of knowledge that it operates on a playing field with the greatest of powers in the universe.

                    h4 The Memescape
                        img.img-fluid(src='content/images/intro_memescape.jpeg')
                    p The memescape is the computer network of Osmium. It is an augmented reality much like that depicted in any near-future fiction, filled with floating glyphs, ethereal interfaces, and informational overlays. Using a memescape rig (usually a band wrapped around a forearm), a person can call up the equivalent of wikipedia for anything they’re looking at, ‘tag’ people they meet with notes, and even have a ‘handshake’ exchange basic information upon first meeting.
                    p More advanced rigs incorporate VI to allow for better analysis of information. The information is only as good as the data onboard – landing on a new planet, you only get information in the most general sense unless you’ve connected with a memescape hub on the planet.
                    h6 Physical Proximity and Computer Access
                    p In a world with gods, time travel, and malevolent AIs, a distributed network is deadly. When a hack of your computer can result in the termination of your life, a distributed network is even more deadly. As such, long before Terrans walked upright, the networking of memescape became completely localized. The ultimate security is proximity and physical ownership.
                    p There is no remote access, no email. Most users cannot access a memescape hub more than one or two hundred feet away. If you wish to send a message to someone distant, you put it in an “outbox”, where it is synced with others memescapes as you pass by. Getting a message to someone on the other side of the planet can often take days, if not weeks. (On dense planets with lots of intercontinental travel, hours.) Another planets can easily take weeks. The best way to get a message out it to wait in the hub of a starport (and indeed, most major starports have special waiting areas just for this purpose).
                    p As such, hacking is a very physical endeavor. To break into a computer, you must either bring yourself to the mountain or bring the mountain to you. Many hackers are elite infiltration experts, capable of breaking past many layers of physical security in order to gain access to the computer.
                    h4 The Universal Translator Virus
                    p The Universal Translator Virus is a virus that predates most known civilizations. It is contagious amongst almost all known biological sentient species. It can be spread by touch, through the air, and through psychic communication.
                    p Its only real symptom is the ability to understand other languages. It is not fatal.
                    p A given infected sentient can learn a language by talking to another sentient within one to two days. Even if they don’t speak or listen to the unknown language, being in close proximity to a group of infected who do speak the language will result in its acquisition. The more of the language the infected listens to, and the more speakers they interact with, the faster acquisition occurs. Landing in a starport, a sentient can often learn to speak the language in as little as two to four hours.
                    p At any given time, between two and four hundred languages can be retained.
                    p If an infected encounters a language in a fixed medium (watching a video, reading a book), the language can take up to a week to decipher, but with a sufficient corpus the virus will eventually translate. If a text is encoded, such that those who speak the language wouldn’t be able to understand it (cyphers, etc.), the virus may or may not be able to decode it, though even then it may take weeks. (Codes are usually solvable, cyphers are usually not.)
                    p The UTV is a cornerstone of modern intergalactic society. It allows a diplomat or trader to land on an unknown planet and speak the language to begin trading by the time their ship is refueled and repaired.
                    h6 The Virus and Authorial Privilege
                    p I speak English and a fair amount of Spanish. So in theory, the UTV should translate all Chinese and Hindi. But I’m not comfortable with that level of “let’s name every character a white person name”. So, in the interests of not naming every character John, any Earth name is considered of sufficient awareness to your characters that it doesn’t need to be translated further. So while you won’t encounter any Tolkienesque Whûn-dora-dhûn, you will encounter Turkish Ismet Sener.

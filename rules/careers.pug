                    p The magic of Osmium is everywhere. Not confined to dusty towers and lost tomes, the ability to wield magic is a technological upgrade no different than a gun upgrade or cybernetic arm. Many pursue magical excellence for direct and physical ends. Whether they are warriors and soldiers who use their magic to ward and to kill, or explorers and merchants and laborers who cast spells to access opportunities others must pass up, the universe knows them as Battlemages.
                    p As adventurers, Battlemages bring a versatility that few can match. Their fortitude and academic backgrounds make them excellent candidates for exploring the unknown. Their training in stealth and intimidation make them capable thieves, and of course, there's always combat spellcraft.

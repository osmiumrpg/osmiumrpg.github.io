                        | The magic of Osmium is everywhere. Not confined to dusty towers and lost tomes, the ability to wield magic is a technological upgrade no different than a gun enhancement or cybernetic arm. Many pursue magical excellence for direct and physical ends. Whether they are warriors and soldiers who use their magic to ward and to kill, or explorers and merchants and laborers who cast spells to access opportunities others must pass up, the universe knows them as Battlemages.
                    p As adventurers, Battlemages bring a versatility that few can match. Their fortitude and academic backgrounds make them excellent candidates for exploring the unknown. Their training in stealth and intimidation make them capable thieves, and of course, there's always combat spellcraft.

                        | Musicians. Memescape jockeys. Courtesans. The methods people employ in the pursuit of consumptive entertainment are as varied as anything in Osmium. The truth is that even in a universe of infinite possibilities, for many entertainers, their art is merely a hobby and they are forced to seek a day job. And even for those that are lucky enough to make a living bringing joy to others, permutations of existing experiences pales in comparison to art inspired by new memories.
                    p There are many campaigns where an entertainer would be out of place. And yet, despite lacking any real combat training, entertainers are capable of supporting their group in many aspects of danger. They are masters of computers, of charm, and of the more… rogueish arts. While they may lack the big guns of other adventurers, the pen is mightier than the sword.

                        | Empires and businesses of Osmium span galaxies, and sometimes even dimensions, and while travel can be as fast as the universe is vast, it is still far-flung. So trusted attendants, with a certain amount of discretion and judgment, are a must. Whether they be diplomats, merchants, investigators, or advocates, trusted independent operatives are what make the great societies #[em work]. 
                    p A group with an envoy can usually arrange access to places and solutions to problems that they otherwise wouldn't even consider. Well-connected, and able to make friends in places where they aren't, envoys usually travel with a retinue of lackeys to make manifest their deals.

                        | Before there was magic, before there was technology, when the first elves were being fashioned from the energy at the heart of a dying star, the first bonds between people were formed. And somebody was tendered with the responsibility of tending to those bonds. Leaders are those who step to the forefront to direct and support their fellows.
                    p Adventuring leaders are jacks-of-all trades, capable of navigating thorny social dynamics, explosive firefights, and strange horizons. The goal of a leader is not to be the best, but to ensure that their group is the best that it can be, and to be capable of making the important decisions when the chips are down.

                        | Some are tramp freighter captains, flying from port to port. Others are starfighters for an empire that may or may not value their lives. Even others are merely operational administrators for the bulk carriers that form the backbone of many great civilizations. But all are possessed of some same qualities, like the ability to think fast and a sense of wanderlust, and all are iconic figures in the eyes of the populace.
                    p Pilots are capable adventurers, providing their team with the combination of hand-eye coordination, technical aptitude, and situational awareness that allows them to fill many roles, whether it be a gunman in the forefront, or hacker in the back, or a wheelman on the side.

                        | Becoming a spellcaster is an isolating process. The extensive surgeries to implant the cybernetics throughout your body. The training to use those implants that veers back and forth between physical therapy and actual torture. The need to understand the secret underpinnings of the universe to even make your magic work. It doesn’t leave a lot of time for making friends.
                    p And yet. Some spellcasters emerge from the process with a new found appreciation for the company of others. Or with a deeper understanding of how to use people as tools. Either way, those spellcasters are capable of acts of guile and savoir faire that may actually be magic.
                    p These sorcerers work well in an adventuring party when their magic can cover for them in physical situations, as they lack the training to do anything other than ensorcell, dissemble, and hide. But from a place of hiding, either in shadows or in secrets, sorcerers can be counted on to step forward and carry the day for their compatriots.

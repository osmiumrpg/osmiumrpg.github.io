They gain a free extra maneuver (though they still cannot take more than 2 maneuvers), and the target is not affected by difficult terrain, nor can they be immobilized.

                    p #[strong Concentration:] No
                    p #[strong Skills:] Blue Magic, Purple Magic
                    p Magic attacks are combat checks, and they follow the normal rules for performing a combat check, on Core Rules page 101, using the character’s magic skill instead of a combat skill.
                    p When making a magic attack, the character must select one target at short range (but not engaged). The default difficulty of the check is #[strong Easy (#[span.dice.difficulty d])]. The attack deals damage equal to the characteristic linked to the skill used to make the attack (so if the character uses Blue Magic, they would deal damage equal to their Intellect), plus 1 damage per uncanceled #[span.genesys s]. The attack has no set Critical rating, so you may only inflict a Critical Injury with a #[span.genesys t].
                    p Before making a magic attack check, choose any number of additional effects listed on the Additional Effects table. These effects are added to the attack.

                    p This is using magic to enhance people. A character selects one target they are engaged with (which can be themself), then makes a magic skill check. The default difficulty of the check is #[strong Average (#[span.dice.difficulty dd])]. If the check is successful, until the end of your character’s next turn, the target increases the ability of any skill checks they make by one (in effect, this means they add #[span.dice.ability d] to their checks).
                    p A character may not be affected by more than one Augment spell at the same time (so no stacking effects).

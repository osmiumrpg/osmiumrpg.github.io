                    p 
                        em Uses Intellect. 
                        | Basically Biotics from Mass Effect, with a little more elemental magic. Very immediate, few long-term rituals.
                    h5 Lore
                    p
                        em Uses Intellect. 
                        | The study of lost and forbidden knowledge. Anything a well-traveled scientist wouldn’t reasonably know.
                    h5 Operating
                    p Not a skill. The Operating skill doesn’t exist in Osmium but the concept does. When making a Piloting roll for a sufficiently large vehicle, one big enough that physical reflexes matter less than trigonometry, use Intellect instead of Agility (but still use Piloting).
                    h5 Purple Magic
                    p 
                        em Uses Cunning. 
                        | Essentially Faerie magic.
                    h5 Ranged [Projectile] and Ranged [Energy]
                    p 
                        em Uses Agility. 
                        | One fires bullets, the other fires blasts of energy. Energy guns are generally better out of the gate, but can’t use specialized ammo. Projectile guns might do a little less damage, but they can be fitted with ammo designed to hurt the fight you’re itchin’ for.
                    h5 Red Magic
                    p 
                        em Uses Willpower. 
                        | Halfway between Warlock and Druid magic. Magic of mutation and diseases and blood.
                    h5 Science
                    p 
                        em Uses Intellect.
                    h5 Travel

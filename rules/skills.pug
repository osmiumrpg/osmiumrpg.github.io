                    h3 Blue Magic [Intellect]
                    p The Blue Magic skill represents your ability to manipulate the underlying physical forces of the universe, such as gravity, time, and the four elements. (Anybody who says the four elements aren't an underlying physical force of the universe is from a backward planet and you shouldn't listen to them.) Blue Magic can be used to cast spells and identify powerful sources of magic in the world.
                    h5 Your character should use this skill if...
                    ul 
                        li Your characters wants to throw a fireball at a group of enemies.
                        li Your character wants to erect powerful walls of force to protect or to ward.
                        li Your character wants to be able to counter otherspellcasters' efforts, and be the best at doing so.
                        li Your character wants to move things with magic, as Blue Mages are the most powerful telekinetics.
                    h5 Your character should not use this skill if...
                    ul
                        li Your character attempts to charm or curse a target. (Use Purple Magic instead.)
                        li Your character attempts to heal a target. (Use Red Magic instead.)

                    h3 Lore
                    p
                        em Uses Intellect. 
                        | The study of lost and forbidden knowledge. Anything a well-traveled scientist wouldn't reasonably know.
                    h3 Operating
                    p Not a skill. The Operating skill doesn't exist in Osmium but the concept does. When making a Piloting roll for a sufficiently large vehicle, one big enough that physical reflexes matter less than trigonometry, use Intellect instead of Agility (but still use Piloting).
                    h3 Purple Magic [Cunning]
                    p There are forces outside our universe. Parallel dimensions. Ethereal planes home to ageless elements. Lost timelines filled with Lovecraftian entities screaming to get in. Purple Magic makes use of these things from the outside. Mastered and brought into our universe by the fey, Purple Magic is a magic of subtlety and charm.
                    h5 Your character should use this skill if...
                    ul 
                        li Your character wants to make psychic attacks against another.
                        li Your character wants to enchant someone with dark strength or alien cunning.
                        li Your character wants to curse their opponents with bad luck and clumsineness.
                        li Your character wants to make illusions or use magic to access places they shouldn't.
                    h5 Your character should use this skill if...
                    ul 
                        li Your character wants to make savage attacks or permanent change. (Use Red Magic instead.)
                        li Your character wants to bolster their defenses. (Use Blue Magic instead.)
                    
                    h3 Ranged [Projectile] and Ranged [Energy]
                    p 
                        em Uses Agility. 
                        | One fires bullets, the other fires blasts of energy. Energy guns are generally better out of the gate, but can't use specialized ammo. Projectile guns might do a little less damage, but they can be fitted with ammo designed to hurt the fight you're itchin' for.

                    p

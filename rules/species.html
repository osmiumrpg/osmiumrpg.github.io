Seven Wastes sector as adventurers and travelers. The diaspora of Terrans is no longer being forced by the Hegemony, and yet it continues as strong as before since the liberation of Earth. Terrans are a hearty people, possessed of a desire to learn and a willingness to make do that other species lack. Even separated from their homeworld, they share enough cultural identity to make a name for themselves.</p><ul><li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Terrans begin with one rank in each of two different non-career skills.

They are caretakers of the Sphinx’s wishes, a client race of the demigods who know everything. Not all Grovers choose to serve the Sphinx, though – there are millions who travel live independent lives. Yet even these free Grovers hold the Sphinx in high regard, for their world’s place in the universe is at the feet of the Philosopher Kings.</p><p>Slightly green in hue as humans go, Grovers usually have brown, black, or auburn hair, with eyes that are always a deep jade. Their blood contains far more oxygen than most Human blood, making them ideal donors.</p><p>Grovers are experts in information, possessed by a conversational style that always draws out more than they reveal. While tests of individual Grovers reveal no unusual psionic energy, large groups of Grovers do generate ripples against psychic backdrops. Whether their inability to be read, and their innate ability to read patterns in both faces and texts, is magic in nature or mundane, Grovers are well regarded as investigators and brokers.</p><p><strong>Special Abilities. </strong></p><ul> <li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Grovers begin with one rank in Negotiation.

They tend to follow the convention of a given name at birth and a surname reflecting the leader of their extended family unit. The leader of the family unit tends to be whomever has the greatest standing with the family's Sphinx.</p><p> <button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-grover-female" onclick="populate_name_label_random('grover', 'female')">Generate Female Name</button>&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-grover-male" onclick="populate_name_label_random('grover', 'male')">Generate Male Name</button></p><p><strong>Name: </strong><label id="label-grover-name"></label></p><h5 class="text-center" id="Spacer">Spacer</h5><p> <img class="img-fluid img-right-floater" src="./../content/images/species_spacer.png"/>Many humans grow up so far removed from any other culture that their culture becomes that of the wandering byways of space. Spacers are humans who have been away from a homeworld for so long that they have no real knowledge of where their ancestors came from, but instead are part of an amalgam of human races who share a culture of living on stations and starships and the lost realms between the stars.</p><ul> <li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Spacers begin with one rank in Piloting.

They are a race of perseverence and commitment unmatched anywhere. The oath of a dwarf is certainty. A culture built around this kind of fortitude ends up becoming a pillar of the galaxies.</p><p>In addition to the value of loyalty, a Dwarf values pragmatism. They are not adverse to aesthetics or ceremony, because those things have their uses and their value, but pomp and circumstance are not their way. They choose the best option for all possible scenarios, and then commit to it. If something needs to be cut, or left behind, or abandoned, they do so, ruthlessly and without regret - everything should be useful, and that which is not is disposed of.</p><p>The original home planet of the dwarves is unknown. The legends tell of a time when the god Moradin fashioned the dwarves out of matter created during the First Big Bang. Dwarves have had less genetic drift than other species - each subspecies of dwarf is still very close to each other - and yet, those tiny differences mean everything to people who make every promise for life.</p><p><strong>Physiology. </strong> Dwarves are built for hardiness. Their relentless focus on pragnatism means they have spent millenia living in uncomfortable places, if that's what their task demanded. Their genome shows signs of genetic modification, likely at their own hand. Their bodies have redundancies unseen in species save for those creatd for war. Redunancies such as extra veins and arteries (and the ones they have can seal themselves), dense bone structures, redundant glands, and a six-chambered heart.</p><p>They are a squat species, generally 4' to 5'2" in height, but upwards of 150 to 200lbs. They usually live between three and four hundred years in length, though most wealthy dwarven communities have access to plenty of age-enhancing technologies.</p><p><strong>Society. </strong> Every body of people in Dwarven society tends to value outcomes and autonomy. Loyalty to each other and a loathing of inefficiency means people are trusted to do their jobs. Bureaucracy where it can be found has been proven time and again to give value to the community. Laws are well-documented and made with an attempt to be fair, but any given interpretation can be overridden by a tribunal or community leader if need be. Ultimately, Dwarven society reflects practical choices: if the financial, magical, environmental, and societal costs make sense for a factory to be built in the middle of a residential neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be displaced. While aesthetics and form are recognized as having value, function always reigns supreme.</p><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">2</span><span class="agi">2</span><span class="int">2</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">3</span><span class="pre">1</span></div><ul> <li><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 10 + Brawn</li><li><strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 10 + Willpower</li><li><strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 90 XP</li><li><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Each type of Dwarf has its own special abilities, listed in the corresponding entry.</li></ul><h5 class="text-center">Cog Dwarf</h5><p>Cog Dwarves are counters. They are archivists, quartermasters, accountants, and tabulators. Cog Dwarves are, even for dwarves, keen on first establishing the known facts. <em>What is</em> must be truly understood before <em>what might be</em> can be tackled. They are not myopic about inventory to the point of impracticality, but a lack of quantification of their own assets (both literal and abstract) will drive them mad.</p><p>Two thousand years ago, the Cog Dwarves sold their homeworld to the Aven and joined the Hegemony. For what, nobody knows. But they have made themselves right at home in the Hegemony, with their nature to count a perfect match with the Aven's particular way of looking at property ownership.</p><p>Cog Dwarves tend to be bronze in complexion, with hair ranging from red to brown to black. Unlike the Hulk Dwarves, the women don't have beards. Their eyes tend to brown or black, though a few are born with eyes like green emeralds, known as "emerald children".</p><p>Cog Dwarves tend to favor adornments woven into their hair or worn as bracelets or brooches, because piercings and tattoos are seen as commitments, and a changing fashion should not be promised for life. Their clothes tend to be very functional, ready for their jobs at hand. Most situations involving 'nice clothes' are dealt with by adding a fair amount of jewelry to their newest or most expensive regular clothes.</p><ul> <li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Cog Dwarves begin with one rank in Negotiation. You still cannot train their Negotiation above rank 2 during character creation.</li><li><strong>Dark Vision:</strong> When making skill checks, Cog Dwarves remove up to <span class="dice setback">bb</span> imposed due to darkness.</li><li><strong>Tough as Nails:</strong> Once per session, a Cog Dwarf may spend a Story Point as an out-of-turn incidental immediately after suffering a Critical Injury and determining the result. If they do so, they count the result rolled as “01.”</li></ul><p><strong>Naming Conventions. </strong> As a race, Cog Dwarves are <em>obsessed</em> with their family tree. A Cog Dwarf who can't trace there lineage back at least 2,000 years is viewed with suspicion. As such, the notion of a family tree is a rather expansive one. As such, family names tend to include an adjective for a given branch. You are not just Emmita of the Zenith, but of the <em>Dawning</em> Zenith, as distinct from the <em>August</em> Zenith.</p><p> <button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-cogdwarf-female" onclick="populate_name_label_random('cogdwarf', 'female')">Generate Female Name </button>&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-cogdwarf-male" onclick="populate_name_label_random('cogdwarf', 'male')">Generate Male Name</button></p><p><strong>Name: </strong><label id="label-cogdwarf-name"></label></p><hr/><h3 class="text-center" id="Elf">Elf</h3><p> <img class="img-fluid img-right-floater" src="./../content/images/species_elf.png"/>Elves are an ancient race, masters of ancient magic. They are the only species capable of traveling via The Ways, and their ability to exist in places of dangerous purity is unsurpassed. They are curious beings, driven by purpose but enabled by their long lives to take moments, sometimes years, to enjoy themselves and to reflect.</p><p>All elves once originated on the lost planet of Avalon, though that was tens of thousands of years ago. The species of elves have since diverged, yet more than any other species, they have a respect for each other, no matter their culture or nationality.</p><p><strong>Physiology. </strong> Elves are exemplars of primal beauty. They are never ugly, merely <em>haunting</em> or <em>too beautiful</em>, aesthetically compelling even to races wholly alien to Elves (like Vrar or Mind Flayers). They are a little shorter than Humans, between 4'10" and 6', and lighter, weighing between 100 and 160 pounds. Even without age-enhancement technology, Elves live between four and six hundred years. Elves exhibit even less sexual dimorphism than Humans, with the only differences being males weigh ever so slightly more, and females tend to live a few decades longer.</p><p><strong>Society. </strong> Elven society tends to value tradition above all else. Whether this is because they are <em>stuck in their ways</em> or <em>taking the long view</em> depends on who you ask. Held positions, whether appointed or elected, tend to be measured in decades. Projects are undertaken that may not see completion for a century, as a matter of course. Change is viewed as inevitable, but haste is viewed with suspicion.</p><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">2</span><span class="agi">3</span><span class="int">2</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">1</span><span class="pre">2</span></div><ul> <li><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 9 + Brawn</li><li><strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 11 + Willpower</li><li><strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 100 XP</li><li><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Each type of Elf has its own special abilities, listed in the corresponding entry.</li></ul><h5 class="text-center">Summer Elf</h5><p>Summer Elves are beings of faith. No matter their walk in life, the Summer Elves are always mindful of their oaths to and relationships with their pantheon. This serenity and sense of place gives Summer Elves an inner strength that other Elves may lack, and a social grace that parallels their agility.</p><p>Most Summer Elves are citizens of the Federation, a council species found on all government ships. Their obligations of faith work in concert with the methods of democratic expansionism pursued by the Federation. Those few Summer Elves not raised in the Federation often chafe at the assumptions made by others about their status as a Federal Elf.</p><p>Summer Elves have a very narrow band of coloration, either very blond or black hair, and skin ranging from very pale to dark brown. Their eyes are either brown or blue. They generally lack body or facial hair. </p><p>Federal Elves tend to dress in crisp, formal robes. The robes vary in color, but are usually mostly monochromatic (with some shade differences within the outfit). They tend to favor jewelry on the neck and wrists, with none on the face.</p><ul><li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Summer Elves begin with one rank in Discipline. You still cannot train their Discipline above rank 2 during character creation. </li><li><strong>Serenity of Purpose:</strong> Summer Elves gain Charm as a career skill and begin with one rank in Charm. You still cannot train their Charm above rank 2 during character creation.</li></ul><p><strong>Naming Conventions. </strong> Summer Elves take surnames describing a constellation or stellar body visible from their family home. The 'family home' is an old place, and the adoption of a new family home is akin to starting a new family. Summer Elves are not usually named by their parents until they are twenty or thirty, when a name befitting their personality and aesthetic can be decided upon.</p><p> <button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-summerelf-female" onclick="populate_name_label_random('summerelf', 'female')">Generate Female Name </button>&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-summerelf-male" onclick="populate_name_label_random('summerelf', 'male')">Generate Male Name</button></p><p><strong>Name: </strong><label id="label-summerelf-name"></label></p><hr/><h3 class="text-center" id="Halfling">Halfling</h3><p> <img class="img-fluid img-right-floater" src="./../content/images/species_shadowfoothalfling.png"/>All Halflings have emerged onto the universe's stage as clients of greater empires. Halflings are almost as ubiquitous as Humans, and yet none are the leaders of an empire of their own. Always in the shadow of another species, they as a people are fierce yet cognizant that they have alway survived standing behind somebody else.</p><p>Nobody knows from where the Halflings originate, and honestly, nobody really cares. Halflings are focusd on the present, on living their lives today and now. And since they've never been the center of a culture of great might, nobody else cares to dig up their old artifacts.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Physiology. </strong> Small in stature, Halflings range from 40 to 45 pounds, between 3 and 3'6". Young Halflings start lean, but they tend to gain weight as they age. Females tend to be slightly taller and heavier than the males. The Halfling lifespan is only about 60 years, but Halflings are incredibly receptive to rejuvenative technologies and magics.</p><p><strong>Society. </strong> Halflings exist as vassals of other species. Whether that’s genetic, cosmic circumstance, destiny, or something else, nobody really knows. And yet. Halflings have never carved out their own turf on the universe’s map. Their societies reflect this. Halflings tend to build their communities and customs as appendages on the inner workings of larger cultures. Their customs tend to be variations on the pattern established by their patrons.</p><p>Yet Halflings are always focused on community. Friends, family, brethren. Halfling society, whatever norms its established under, always values a welcoming hearth, an inviting home, and the value of good company.</p><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">1</span><span class="agi">3</span><span class="int">2</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">2</span><span class="pre">2</span></div><ul><li><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 11 + Brawn</li><li><strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 9 + Willpower</li><li><strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 100 XP</li><li><strong>Small:</strong> Halflings have a Silhouette of 0.</li></ul><h5 class="text-center">Shadowfoot Halfling</h5><p>The Shadowfoot Halflings have always existed in the Commune. Originally, as slaves to the Mind Flayers, before eventually earning their independence. Their underground network of freed slaves, terrorists, and abolitionists, informs their culture to this day. Even as freed members of the Commune, many holding positions of great importance, as a people they still remember when they were second-class citizens of the Mind Flayers. And their food.</p><p>The Shadowfoot should have been extinct long ago. The fact that they survived in the face of the Mind Flayer Commune’s purges of hunger is a miracle. The Shadowfoot Halflings know it is because they were able to keep themselves invisible. Not just through acts of stealth, but through magic, social engineering, and engineering. Shadowfoot Halflings believe in hiding from the world until they feel there is opportunity to reveal themselves.</p><p>Commune Shadowfoot tend to dress in very simple clothing. Historically, they favored blacks and dark purples, though reds and whites have become more popular as they have taken their place as full citizens of the Commune. Halflings favor pouches and purses to pockets, wanting to be able to shed weight as quickly as possible should they need to.</p><ul><li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Shadowfoot Halflings begin with one rank in Stealth. You still cannot train their Stealth above rank 2 during character creation. </li><li><strong>Nimble:</strong> A Shadowfoot Halfling may purchase an extra maneuver for 1 strain, if they use that maneuver to disengage from an adversary with a Silhouette of 1 or greater. They still may not take more than two maneuvers in a turn.</li><li><strong>Lucky:</strong> Once per session, a Shadowfoot Halfling may reroll a dice roll, either one they made, or one that was made targeting them.</li></ul><p><strong>Naming Conventions. </strong> Shadowfoot Halflings are named when they have a tale worth telling. Those who are present then give them a name. They take the names of their mother and father’s clans (often the same).</p><p> <button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-shadofoothalfling-female" onclick="populate_name_label_random('shadowfoothalfling', 'female')">Generate Female Name </button>&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-shadofoothalfling-male" onclick="populate_name_label_random('shadowfoothalfling', 'male')">Generate Male Name</button></p><p><strong>Name: </strong><label id="label-shadofoothalfling-name"></label></p><hr/><h3 class="text-center">Kua-Toa</h3><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">2</span><span class="agi">2</span><span class="int">1</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">3</span><span class="pre">2</span></div><hr/><h3 class="text-center">Mind Flayer</h3><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">2</span><span class="agi">2</span><span class="int">2</span><span class="cun">3</span><span class="wil">1</span><span class="pre">2</span></div><hr/><h3 class="text-center" id="Recog">Recognitive</h3><p> <img class="img-fluid img-right-floater" src="./../content/images/species_recognitive.png"/>Ostensibly, they were once Human. Yet millenia ago, Recognitives embraced their cybernetic nature and never looked back. Now, they are genetically distinct, and their bodies are wholly dependent on their cybernetic halves. Recognitives are fused with cybernetic <em>in utero</em>, and their minds are part machine before they even have their first thought.</p><p>Recognitives have bands of redundant neural tubing running out of their heads. This neural tubing provides extra processing power for the mind, and makes every Recognitive nearly eidetic. Not only can a Recognitive remember almost everything that's happened to them - they can remember things that have happened to <em>others</em>.</p><p>These neural tubes allow them to codify memories and exchange them. This makes Recognitives experts on all subjects - with enough time and enough fellow Recognitives, a 'Recog' can find the memories of a surgeon, implanting months of surgical memories into their head, making them at least competent at first aid. A Recog can only have so many memories that don't belong to them in their head before they begin to lose their sense of self, so they tend to trade these kinds of memories frequently.</p><p><strong>Physiology. </strong> Recognitives look like Humans with extensive cybermodifications. The usual way to tell a Recog from a cyborg Human is generally the level of advancement of the cybernetics, and the traditional 'dreds' or neural tubing. Recogs tend to vary in coloration, having skin, hair, and eye colors of any and all under the rainbow.</p><p><strong>Society. </strong> Recognitives tend to live amongst themselves. It is a rare Recog who travels at length away from their people, because others cannot share memories in the same way. Indeed, Recogs find other species off-putting because they do not have introductory memories. Every Recog has a set of memories they share with others they meet, memories that describe who they are: a treasured concert, a quiet moment in their favorite coffee shop, a hug from their father. The universal standard of a memescape handshake pales in comparison: why tell someone how you like your coffee prepared when you can just let them remember your favorite cup?</p><p>Because of their nature, Recog society tends to value generalization. Since anybody can ramp up to competence in a few weeks of basic tasks, people tend to jump careers frequently. Even so, their truly fantastic memories make them well suited to master many fields. Some of the best doctors, scientists, and engineers in the Federation are Recogs.</p><p><strong>Naming Conventions. </strong> Recognitives tend to take very formal and ritualistic names. They are all numbered, because every Recog has a unique name. In the rare instance where two Recogs have the same numbering (say, an isolated colony or a lost ship), the two will meet and come to some form of arrangement. The arrangement might be a duel, a cash payment, or some other form of competition or trade. But only one can have the original numbering, and the other must choose a new one. In casual conversation, Recogs tend to go by their last name and their number, working their way forward through their names as disambiguation is needed.</p><p> <button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-recog-male" onclick="populate_name_label_random('recog', 'female')">Generate Name</button></p><p><strong>Name: </strong><label id="label-recog-name"></label></p><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">2</span><span class="agi">2</span><span class="int">3</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">2</span><span class="pre">1</span></div><ul><li><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 11 + Brawn</li><li><strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 11 + Willpower</li><li><strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 100 XP</li><li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Recognitives start the game with one rank in Mechanics.

If you are allied with that cause, they will guard your flank until they fall. Oppose them, and they are an unstoppable force. Most commonly associated with the Federation, the Vrar are found everywhere in the universe.</p><p><strong>Physiology. </strong> Vrars are big bears. Ursine creatures who walk upright, with claws capable of fine manipulation and feet capable of supporting them as they run or climb. They are omnivores, who tend to sleep for long stretches (about 12 of the 30 hours of their homeworld’s day). Their thick hide often protects them from the cold, though they can handle hot climates well enough.</p><p><strong>Society. </strong> The Vrar are very focused on service and their community. They are champions of great causes, and protectors of those they call kith and kin. Vrar society is one of clans and fraternities. Every organization is named, and Vrar have an intuitive understanding of its membership. Vrar do not traditionally aspire to power over others, but rather membership in the most respected groups and the success of causes they believe in.</p><p><strong>Naming Conventions. </strong> Vrar do not take many names. Their are very few names, and most people know a dozen people with their name. However, their strong focus on community impacts their language, and by context the reference is usually clear. You may know twenty people named Gertrude just like you, but you're the only one in your squad or your immeidate family. When clarification is needed, you use a nickname. Taking a nickname is usually a sign of maturity in Federal Vrar culture, because it means you are a prominent enough member of enough communities that distinguishing you is important. It is a sign of power to go without your nickname - you are <em>the</em> Gertrude; though if you lack the gravitas to pull it off, you often look foolish.</p><p> <button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-vrar-female" onclick="populate_name_label_random('vrar', 'female')">Generate Female Name</button>&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-secondary" id="generate-vrar-male" onclick="populate_name_label_random('vrar', 'male')">Generate Male Name</button></p><p><strong>Name: </strong><label id="label-vrar-name"></label></p><h5 class="text-center">Species Ability</h5><div class="archetype"><span class="bra">3</span><span class="agi">2</span><span class="int">1</span><span class="cun">2</span><span class="wil">2</span><span class="pre">2</span></div><ul> <li><strong>Wound Threshold:</strong> 14 + Brawn</li><li><strong>Strain Threshold:</strong> 8 + Willpower</li><li><strong>Starting Experience:</strong> 90 XP</li><li><strong>Starting Skills:</strong> Vrar start the game with one rank in Brawl.

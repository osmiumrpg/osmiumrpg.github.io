                    p The planet Earth is a recent addition to the galactic stage, but they’re making a splash in the Seven Wastes sector as adventurers and travelers. The diaspora of Terrans is no longer being forced by the Hegemony, and yet it continues as strong as before since the liberation of Earth. Terrans are a hearty people, possessed of a desire to learn and a willingness to make do that other species lack. Even separated from their homeworld, they share enough cultural identity to make a name for themselves.

                        | Grovers are a race of humans from a planet deep within the Philosopher Kingdom. They are caretakers of the Sphinx’s wishes, a client race of the demigods who know everything. Not all Grovers choose to serve the Sphinx, though – there are millions who travel live independent lives. Yet even these free Grovers hold the Sphinx in high regard, for their world’s place in the universe is at the feet of the Philosopher Kings.
                    p Slightly green in hue as humans go, Grovers usually have brown, black, or auburn, with eyes that are always a deep jade. Their blood contains far more oxygen than most Human blood, making them ideal donors.
                    p Grovers are experts in information, possessed by a conversational style that always draws out more than they reveal. While tests of individual Grovers reveal no unusual psionic energy, large groups of Grovers do generate ripples against psychic backdrops. Whether their inability to be read, and their innate ability to read patterns in both faces and texts, is magic in nature or mundane, Grovers are well regarded as investigators and brokers.

Spacers are humans who have been away from a homeworld for so long that they have no real knowledge of where their ancestors came from, but instead are part of an amalgam of human races who share a culture of living on stations and starships and the lost realms between the stars.

                        | There is no force in the universe stronger than a dwarf. They are a race of perseverence and commitment unmatched anywhere. The oath of a dwarf is certainty. A culture built around this kind of fortitude ends up becoming a pillar of the galaxies.
                    p In addition to the value of loyalty, a Dwarf values pragmatism. They are not adverse to aesthetics or ceremony, because those things have their uses and their value, but pomp and circumstance are not their way. They choose the best option for all possible scenarios, and then commit to it. If something needs to be cut, or left behind, or abandoned, they do so, ruthlessly and without regret - everything should be useful, and that which is not is disposed of.
                    p The original home planet of the dwarves is unknown. The legends tell of a time when the god Moradin fashioned the dwarves out of matter created during the First Big Bang. Dwarves have had less genetic drift than other species - each subspecies of dwarf is still very close to each other - and yet, those tiny differences mean everything to people who make every promise for life.
                    p #[strong Physiology. ] Dwarves are built for hardiness. Their relentless focus on pragnatism means they have spent millenia living in uncomfortable places, if that's what their task demanded. Their genome shows signs of genetic modification, likely at their own hand. Their bodies have redundancies unseen in species save for those creatd for war. Redunancies such as extra veins and arteries (and the ones they have can seal themselves), dense bone structures, redundant glands, and a six-chambered heart.
                    p They are a squat species, generally 4' to 5'2" in height, but upwards of 150 to 200lbs. They usually live between three and four hundred years in length, though most wealthy dwarven communities have access to plenty of age-enhancing technologies.

                    p Cog Dwarves are counters. They are archivists, quartermasters, accountants, and tabulators. Cog Dwarves are, even for dwarves, keen on first establishing the known facts. #[em What is] must be truly understood before #[em what might be] can be tackled. They are not myopic about inventory to the point of impracticality, but a lack of quantification of their own assets (both literal and abstract) will drive them mad.
                    p Two thousand years ago, the Cog Dwarves sold their homeworld to the Aven and joined the Hegemony. For what, nobody knows. But they have made themselves right at home in the Hegemony, with their nature to count at perfect match with the Aven's particular way of looking at property ownership.
                    p Cog Dwarves tend to be bronze in complexion, with hair ranging from red to brown to black. Unlike the Hulk Dwarves, the women don't have beards. Their eyes tend to brown or black, though a few are born with eyes like green emeralds, known as "emerald children".
                    p Cog Dwarves tend to favor adornments woven into their hair or worn as bracelets or brooches, because piercings and tattoos are seen as commitments, and a changing fashion should not be promised for life. Their clothes tend to be very functional, ready for their jobs at hand. Most situations involving 'nice clothes' are dealt with by adding a fair amount of jewelry to their newest or most expensive regular clothes.

                        | Elves are an ancient race, masters of ancient magic. They are the only species capable of traveling via The Ways, and their ability to exist in places of dangerous purity is unsurpassed. They are curious beings, driven by purpose but enabled by their long lives to take moments, sometimes years, to enjoy themselves and to reflect.
                    p All elves once originated on the lost planet of Avalon, though that was tens of thousands of years ago. The species of elves have since diverged, yet more than any other species, they have a respect for each other, no matter their culture or nationality.
                    p #[strong Physiology. ] Elves are exemplars of primal beauty. They are never ugly, merely #[em haunting] or #[em too beautiful], aesthetically compelling even to races wholly alien to Elves (like Vrar or Mind Flayers). They are a little shorter than Humans, between 4'10" and 6', and lighter, weighing between 100 and 160 pounds. Even without age-enhancement technology, Elves live between four and six hundred years. Elves exhibit even less sexual dimorphism than Humans, with the only differences being males weigh ever so slightly more, and females tend to live a few decades longer.
                    p #[strong Society. ] Elven society tends to value tradition above all else. Whether this is because they are #[em stuck in their ways] or #[em taking the long view] depends on who you ask. Held positions, whether appointed or elected, tend to be measured in decades. Projects are undertaken that may not see completion for a century, as a matter of course. Change is viewed as inevitable, but haste is viewed with suspicion.

                    p Summer Elves are beings of faith. No matter their walk in life, the Summer Elves are always mindful of their oaths to and relationships with their pantheon. This serenity and sense of place gives Summer Elves an inner strength that other Elves may lack, and a social grace that parallels their agility.
                    p Most Summer Elves are citizens of the Federation, a council species found on all government ships. Their obligations of faith work in concert with the methods of democratic expansionism pursued by the Federation. Those few Summer Elves not raised in the Federation often chafe at the assumptions made by others about their status as a Federal Elf.
                    p Summer Elves have a very narrow band of coloration, either very blond or black hair, and skin ranging from very pale to dark brown. Their eyes are either brown or blue. They generally lack body or facial hair. 
                    p Federal Elves tend to dress in crisp, formal robes. The robes vary in color, but are usually mostly monochromatic (with some shade differences within the outfit). They tend to favor jewelry on the neck and wrists, with none on the face.

The 'family home' is an old place, and the adoption of a new family home is akin to starting a new family. Summer Elves are not usually named by their parents until they are twenty or thirty, when a name befitting their personality and aesthetic can be decided upon.

                        | Strong in body and hale in spirit, Vrar are vanguards of a cause. If you are allied with that cause, they will guard your flank until they fall. Oppose them, and they are an unstoppable force. Most commonly associated with the Federation, the Vrar are found everywhere in the universe.
                    p #[strong Physiology. ] Vrars are big bears. Ursine creatures who walk upright, with claws capable of fine manipulation and feet capable of supporting them as they run or climb. They are omnivores, who tend to sleep for long stretches (about 12 of the 30 hours of their homeworld’s day). Their thick hide often protects them from the cold, though they can handle hot climates well enough.
                    p #[strong Society. ] The Vrar are very focused on service and their community. They are champions of great causes, and protectors of those they call kith and kin. Vrar society is one of clans and fraternities. Every organization is named, and Vrar have an intuitive understanding of its membership. Vrar do not traditionally aspire to power over others, but rather membership in the most respected groups and the success of causes they believe in.
                    p #[strong Naming Conventions. ] Vrar do not take many names. Their are very few names, and most people know a dozen people with their name. However, their strong focus on community impacts their language, and by context the reference is usually clear. You may know twenty people named Gertrude just like you, but you're the only one in your squad or your immeidate family. When clarification is needed, you use a nickname. Taking a nickname is usually a sign of maturity in Federal Vrar culture, because it means you are a prominent enough member of enough communities that distinguishing you is important. It is a sign of power to go without your nickname - you are #[em the] Gertrude; though if you lack the gravitas to pull it off, you often look foolish.

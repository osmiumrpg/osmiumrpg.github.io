                    p When making any Knowledge skill check, your character can instead use this talent to spend an amount of currency equal to fifty times the difficulty of the check and automatically succeed on the Knowledge check with one uncanceled #[span.genesys s] (instead of rolling). At your GM’s discretion, your character may not be able to use Bought Info if the information is particularly sensitive or difficult to find, or buying it doesn’t make narrative sense.

                    +talentstat('1', 'Passive', 'No', '[Computers]')

                    p Your character removes up to #[span.dice.setback bb] from any skill checks they make to find food, water, or shelter. Checks to forage or search the area that your character makes take half the time they would normally.
